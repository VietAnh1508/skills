# ux-audit

An automated UX auditor that navigates your app like a first-time user. Give it a scenario — a URL, a persona, and a journey to walk — and it opens a real browser, moves through each step, captures screenshots at key states, and produces a structured findings report with specific, actionable issues.

Works for any web app: authenticated flows, onboarding, checkout, settings, anything with a user journey worth testing.

## Quick start

**Single scenario file:**

```
/ux-audit path/to/my-scenario.md
```

**All scenarios in a directory (runs in parallel):**

```
/ux-audit path/to/scenarios/
```

**Inline — describe the scenario in your message:**

```
/ux-audit  ← then describe what to test
```

**Static review — share screenshots directly:**

```
/ux-audit  ← then attach screenshots
```

## How it works

Two layers run under the hood:

1. **Orchestrator** — reads 1 or N scenarios, spawns one executor sub-agent per scenario in parallel, waits for all to finish, then synthesises the final report.
2. **Executor** — each executor handles one scenario: loads browser tools, walks the journey, evaluates each screen, and writes a structured findings file.

For multiple scenarios the orchestrator deduplicates cross-scenario findings and writes one combined report.

## Creating a scenario file

1. Copy `~/.claude/skills/ux-audit/references/scenario-template.md` into your project (e.g. `.claude/ux-audit/my-scenario.md`)
2. Fill in the app URL, credentials, and journey steps
3. Run `/ux-audit .claude/ux-audit/my-scenario.md`

Keep scenario files in your project — they describe app-specific flows.
